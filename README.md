To analyze the Australian state's School data using Power BI from 2009 to 2018, you can follow these step-by-step instructions: 

Data Collection and Preparation: 

Gather the necessary data for each year from 2009 to 2018, including the number of students, number of teachers, gender distribution, and school sector (private or government). 

Ensure that the data is in a structured format, such as CSV or Excel, with appropriate headers and consistent formatting. 

Data Import in Power BI: 

Open Power BI and create a new report. 

Import the collected data into Power BI by selecting the "Get Data" option and choosing the appropriate file format. 

Select the necessary tables or sheets from the imported data for analysis. 

Data Modeling: 

Create a relationship between the different tables based on the common fields, such as year and state. 

Define appropriate data types for each field, ensuring accuracy in calculations and visualizations. 

Creating Visualizations: 

Number of Students vs. States: 

Use a stacked column or bar chart to display the total number of students in each state for each year. 

Add the necessary filters and slicers to enable interactivity. 

Total Number of Students and Teachers: 

Utilize a card or KPI (Key Performance Indicator) visual to showcase the total number of students and teachers in the selected time range. 

Number of Students by Private and Government Sector vs. States: 

Create a stacked column or bar chart to compare the number of students in private and government sectors across different states for each year. 

Number of Students in Primary and Secondary Schools vs. States: 

Generate a stacked column or bar chart to analyze the distribution of students in primary and secondary schools in each state for each year. 

Number of Female and Male Students vs. States: 

Use a stacked column or bar chart to present the gender distribution of students in each state for the selected time range. 

Teachers by Gender: 

Create a pie chart or stacked column chart to compare the number of male and female teachers across different years. 

Number of Students Year-on-Year Trend: 

Utilize a line chart to demonstrate the trend in the number of students over the years. 

Enable the appropriate time intelligence functions to calculate year-on-year changes. 

Number of Teachers Year-on-Year Trend: 

Generate a line chart to illustrate the trend in the number of teachers over the years. 

Implement time intelligence functions to calculate year-on-year changes. 

Staffs by Function: 

If available, include additional data on staff functions (e.g., administration, support staff). 

Use a stacked column or bar chart to analyze the distribution of staff members across different functions for each year. 

Data Analysis: 

Explore visualizations to identify patterns, trends, and insights. 

Utilize filters, slicers, and drill-through functionality to perform in-depth analysis based on specific criteria. 

Apply measures or calculations to derive additional insights, such as student-teacher ratios or percentage changes. 

Report Sharing: 

Save and publish the report to Power BI service for sharing and collaboration. 

Create a dashboard to provide an overview of key metrics and visualizations. 

Remember to regularly update the data in Power BI as new information becomes available to maintain accurate and up-to-date analysis.
